*gnome-shell-extension-openweather* is a simple extension for displaying weather conditions and forecasts in GNOME Shell, featuring support for multiple locations, no need for WOEID, a symmetrical layout and a settings panel through *gnome-shell-extension-prefs*.

Currently, the weather data, including forecasts for up to ten days, is fetched from [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/).

# Installation

After the installation, restart GNOME Shell (`Alt`+`F2`, `r`, `Enter`) and enable the extension through *gnome-tweak-tool*.

## Through a package manager

### [Debian](http://packages.debian.org/source/unstable/gnome-shell-extension-weather)

Debian uses the (master-) Yahoo-branch !
My fork of the extension is currently only available for unstable/sid.

Install the package through APT (or use your favourite package-manager, e.g. synaptic):

	sudo apt-get install gnome-shell-extension-weather


## Generic (Local installation)

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
* *dconf*,
* *gettext*,
* *pkg-config*,
* *git*,
* *glib2 (and development packages)*,
* *zip*,
* *gnome-common*,
* *autoconf*,
* *automake*,
* *intltool*.
* *gnome-tweak-tool*.

Run the following commands:

	cd ~ && git clone git://github.com/jenslody/gnome-shell-extension-weather.git
	cd ~/gnome-shell-extension-weather
	git checkout openweathermap
	./autogen.sh && make local-install

If you want to use openweathermap.org with gnome-shell 3.6, please use the openweathermap_3.6 branch instead.

	cd ~ && git clone git://github.com/jenslody/gnome-shell-extension-weather.git
