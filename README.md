	./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
	make
	sudo make install
	sudo install -D weather-extension-configurator.py /usr/bin/weather-extension-configurator

That's it!

### Versions

Only for GNOME Shell 3.2 (not tested under GNOME Shell 3.0)

----

### Configuration

Use the `Weather Settings` button to edit the configuration.
You can also use `dconf-editor` or `gsettings` to modify some parameters from the command line.

#### City (`Cambridge, MA` (GNOME Foundation) by default)

You can specify your location using the following command. Perhaps you need quotation marks as in the second command.

    gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.weather city your_city
    gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.weather city "'your_city'"

#### Temperature Units (optional, celsius by default)

You can modify the temperature unit using one of the following commands:

    gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.weather unit celsius
    gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.weather unit fahrenheit

#### Position in Panel (optional, center by default)

The position of this GNOME Shell extension in the panel can be configured to either 'left', 'center' or 'right' (requires restart of GNOME Shell).

    gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.weather position-in-panel center
    gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.weather position-in-panel left
    gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.weather position-in-panel right

#### Translate Weather Conditions (optional, true by default)

You may want to configure whether to translate the weather condition. If enabled, the condition is translated based on the weather code. If disabled, the condition string from Yahoo is taken. Note: Enabling the translation sometimes results in loss of accuracy, e.g., the condition string "PM Thunderstorms" cannot be expressed in terms of weather codes.

    gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.weather translate-condition true
    gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.weather translate-condition false

#### Symbolic Icons (optional, true by default)

If desired, you can enable the usage of full-colored icons to display the weather condition (instead of symbolic icons).

    gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.weather use-symbolic-icons true
    gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.weather use-symbolic-icons false

#### Show Text in Panel (optional, true by default)

You can configure whether to show the weather condition text (aka. comment) together with the temperature in the panel (requires restart). If only weather condition text is undesired, consider show-comment-in-panel option.

    gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.weather show-text-in-panel true
    gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.weather show-text-in-panel false

#### Include condition (optional, false by default)

Configures whether to show the comment (aka. weather condition text, e.g. "Windy", "Clear") in the panel. Note that the temperature is still shown (if undesired, consider show-text-in-panel option).

    gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.weather show-comment-in-panel false
    gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.weather show-comment-in-panel true

#### Refresh Interval (optional, 300 by default)

The interval to refresh the weather information may be set arbitrarily and is specified in seconds.

    gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.weather refresh-interval 300

#### Restart GNOME Shell

Don't forget to restart GNOME Shell:

1. Restart GNOME Shell (`[Alt]+[F2]`, `r`)
2. Fork this project as you like
